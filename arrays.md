An array is a data structure that is used to store collections of data --in an index list.


Let’s break this down. 
What is a data structure? 
It’s a way of organizing data so that you can access that is can be used effectively. A lot of time data structures mimic things found in every day life/nature. So for instance, you’ll may hear data structures like a binary tree or stack or heap or matrix. 

You’ll often be asked later on when problems get more complex, “What is a good data structure for this problem?” This is programmer-speak for, “How can we best organize our data so we can use it easily?"

The most common data structure in a lot of programming?
Arrays. Words commonly used interchangeably with arrays? Lists. Collections.

So we know arrays store data that’s a variable right?
Arrays store your data in a special way — in an indexed way. 
So just like a phone book (that was probably the most common index we had of everyone’s phone number). 

What makes something an index? It’s that it is stored in an automatic order starting at 0. That order is describe through the use of an index.

Let’s look at a graphic representation of an array.

Index order in Javascript, Ruby, Python, C#, R starts at 0. They refer to a language as zero-based. This is common place for most popular languages. I would say the only one that’s 1-based that we need to care about is CSS.
